I will be using this website to publish my (often half-baked, often speculative) thoughts on neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. While the intended audience of these posts is myself, my hope is that making it public will force me to put together something worth revisiting from time to time. Perhaps these writings will be of interest to others as well.
